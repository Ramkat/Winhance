**Winhance** is a C# application designed to optimize and customize your Windows experience. From software management to system optimizations and customization, Winhance provides functions to enhance Windows 10 and 11 systems.

**Winhance** features most of the same enhancements as [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) without needing to do a clean install of Windows.

## Requirements üíª
- Windows 11
  - *Tested on Windows 11 24H2*
  - *Most things should work on Windows 10 22H2 but there are some issues like Microsoft Edge (legacy) removal*

## Installation üì•
